Fake new master/slave protocol for BuildBot which based on AMP http://amp-protocol.net/

Usage:
```
python2 ./run.py
```
if you want to run fake master and slave separately, use
```
python2 ./fake_slave.py
python2 ./fake_master.py
```

Tested on Twisted 12.2.0, but perhaps will be working on older versions.
